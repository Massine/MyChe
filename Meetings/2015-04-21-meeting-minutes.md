\
*Quickly refresh the tasks for the presentation of the day after*\
\
After the meeting with Prof Ben Koo, we needed to refresh between us what had been said and we had to agree with it.\
\
*Determine who will do what for the presentation of the day after*\
\
We decided that each of us will take in charge his own parts of the reports (we divided the work beforehand\'85). Morgane will find an other software to make the frame and the design of the report because Word is really not easy in this situation. After that, she will try to adapt the work already done to the new software (Mac OX one\'97> Pages). She will also try to manage the shape of the parts.\
After all will do their part, Morgane will collect them to put them together with the CAP (Computer Assisted Program).\
\
*Determine how to communicate and in which order*\
\
The way of communication for this part will be by WeChat, Mail (to send all the parts to Morgane) and GitHub (to put all the files and images the project will need to improve).\
