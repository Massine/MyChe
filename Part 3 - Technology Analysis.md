## Used Technologies and some limits ##

Most of carpooling systems could be described as static carpooling systems. The implementation of the concept is usually made through a simple website which can only save and display the available offers. The only advantage of this solution is the simplicity of implementation. A registration is required from potential users to have access to the full functionalities of the website. But unfortunately, the provided functionalities consists only in adding or consulting the offers with different options like the type of the car that don’t change anything to the transportation problematics. For those websites, a data base is necessary to save the uploaded offers and answer the consultation requests. The only technological aspect that is important to deal with is the storage capacity which is absolutely not a problem nowadays. Indeed the management of those databases is very simple.

The websites like Blablacar is included in this category. The consultation of the offers is public but all other functionalities are accessible after a registration. After accessing the result of research on the database, the user can exchange some messages with the driver for the details. All the communications are made publicly and on the website. The carpoolers can have access the personal contact of each other only after buying and finalizing the transaction. Other website, with nonprofit objective, can give access to the personal contacts directly on the offer to reduce the number of operations made on the website. 

The success of those systems doesn’t guarantee a stability for those companies. Indeed, regarding the development of new technologies and the evolution of people’s habits, the existing websites are becoming obsolete and a modification of the technologies seems to be a must.
