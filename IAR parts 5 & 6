Part 5 : Law and Public policyCarpooling becomes more and more famous and used with time. Several countries already have authorized and adopted the concept itself but not without any rules to follow. Some governments put in place very strict laws for drivers and users used to do carpooling.This part deals with some examples of countries that decided to supervise the practice of carpooling and also with some governments actions aimed at encouraging it.Countries examples-	FranceFirst, BlaBlaCar, French leader of long-distance carpooling, is often metioned as one of the finest achievements of French web. Moreover, it is very often cites Carpooling as an opportunity for social and ecological progress.BlaBlaCar has exceeded 10 million of users in 2014, with users all around Europe, plus India, plus Russia…and the expension is not over ! Moreover, following the launch in February of a new service (Uberpop), presented as the « urban carpooling », the company of VTC Uber has been convicted of misleading business practice.According to press reports, many Uberpop drivers were arrested and face up of 3 years in prison and € 45,000 fine. The Interior Ministry has repeated on December : « Uberpop is illegal and will be prohibited from January, 1st 2015,  pursuant to Trevenoud law. », law related to taxis and transport vehicules with drivers.The release of the DGCCRF (Directorate General for Competition, Customer Affaires and Fraud) in February 2014, in response to the launch of Uberpop service, is clear : « the legality of Carpooling has been upheld by the Court of Cassation in a judgment of March 2013, however, it is provided not practiced for profit. Under the carpool passengers’ financial participation is limited to the cost sharing. However, passenger transport, under cover of carpooling, realized profit is illegal. Indeed, it constitutes an unauthorized public transport activity.«  The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) points out that carpooling is permissible under the condition that it is free or that the money paid by people transported corresponds to a cost sharing generated by the use of the vehicle.”How to define a « for-profit-activity » ? How to define « cost sharing » ? The authorities have a tool for this : the scales of cost per kilometer set each year by the Financial Directorate.These scales formalize the cost of travel of a vehicule in particular employee.For an average distance of 15,000 km per year, this cost is estimated by the administration at about € 0,35 per kilometer.There was therefore « shared costs » if the passenger pays the driver less than € 0,35 per kilometer, and one can speak of « profit activity » otherwise.When driver makes a journey between Paris and Nantes with BlaBlaCar, the passenger pays an average of € 24, that to say € 0,06 per kilometer, that is well below € 0,35. So there is no doubt that BlaBlaCar offers a cost-sharing system.The passenger Uberpop, him, pays for his ride €1 plus €0,95 per kilometer plus €0,15 per minute, well above the limit of €0,35 per km. Even applying the commission of 20% that Uber punctures on the gross remuneration received by the driver, the net remuneration received by the driver remains well above €0,35 per km.→ By carpool, the driver is not a driverThe Ministry of the Environment, Transport and Sustainable Development defines carpooling as the joint use of a vehicule by a non-professional driver and one or passengers on a major route or shared route section.To be clear, there is carpooling when the trip could, anyway, was carried by the driver « empthy ». The logic of Carpooling is to optimize the occupancy rate if its vehicule during a journey that would have been undertaken even alone.There is no carpool when a driver as a taxi or VTC, realizes a trip specifically to serve the needs of a passenger.A BlaBlaCar driver does not do a Paris-Strasbourg route to accomodate a passenger wants to go to Alsace. The BlaBlaCar driver will go anyway to Strasbourg, and proposes its seats to passengers wishing to graft to his vehicule.A Uberpop driver, posted to the Concorde is called by a passenger to get it to Bastille and take him to Paris Charles de Gaulle would not have made this trip « vacuum ». He had no reason to go to the airport if it is to receive remuneration fro the passenger, in exchange for the service rendered. Just as a taxi or a VTC.Governments’ actionsPart 6 : Social awareness
