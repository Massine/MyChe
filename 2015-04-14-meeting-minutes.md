*Quickly remember the tasks of each one*

As we decided during the last meeting, each member has to take parts and study them. For this beginning, we remember the tasks that has to be done by each one and make sure that no interference is happening between the parts.

*Explanations about the data, the sources and the comments*

Each one explained what he did during this week. The objective is to understand how we work, where we find data. This could help each of us to vary the sources, have access to new documents… It is also useful to make sure that the data used by each one is from a good source.

*Comments on the Slides*

Each of us made slides to present the related part during the presentation tomorrow. Some of those slides has to be modified. We commented and made suggestions for each part. Then we decided the passage order. The final ppt will be assembled this evening.
