 **Content of the meeting ** 

 *Deciding the content of this first meeting*

- Choosing a product or a service to study
- Choosing a name for the group
- Tasks division
As we want to choose a name related to the product, we decided to work on the subject first


*Choosing a product or a service to study*

Each member had to think about something to study before the meeting. Each one proposed at least one idea. 
Each one briefly presented his ideas and explain why he thinks that it could be a good subject for the analysis report.
After considering all the arguments and investigating more on internet, we choose one idea.

*Choosing a name for the group*

 According to the chosen project, we considered several possible names. At the end we decided to use “MyChe”. 

*Tasks division*

Each member had something to prepare for the presentation on Wednesday class.
