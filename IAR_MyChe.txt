####Key drivers to grow the insect industry (4 pages)
######Acceptance among western people to eat insects (1 page)
Let us put the currently observed Western disgust towards insect consumption in a historical prospect.

Agriculture was born in the Fertile Crescent, a region located in western Asia, ten thousand years ago before quickly spread to Europe. From a nomad hunter-gatherer way of life, men started to domesticate plant and animals to secure their food sources, thus became sedentary.

The domesticated animals were mainly large ones, not only because they were present in these regions but also because they could supply wool, leather, warmth, milk and strength (for farming or transportation) in addition to meat; what insects cannot.
Moreover, the seasonality of insects -especially in these non-tropical regions where most of them hibernate- added to the uncertainty of their supply made them an unreliable source of food for Westerners, and especially urban areas.

In parallel, along with the plant domestication, insects became a pest able to destroy entire harvests. This is one of the reasons why Westerners culturally associate all insects with nuisances. Examples such as mosquitos, ticks, fleas or flies able to transmit illnesses to humans; or termites eating the wood of their constructions only deepened Westerners’ aversion against insects. Not to mention the shapes of insects, seen as monstrous and repulsive by many a European.

Westerners also rapidly associated insect consumption with some primitive behavior inherited from the hunting-gathering times, therefore despicable.

Because of this historical and cultural background, disgust is the first reaction of many a European when suggested to eat insects.
But just as every social norm, it can be changed within some time.

######Legislative security (1 page)
In many countries, there is no regulation for insects as food and feed. This is one of the big barriers to insect mass-production. There are no international guidelines provided by the Codex Alimentaris (a database providing international reference standards for food and feed) either.

On the opposite, there are laws on maximum permissive levels of insect contamination in food products for humans such as grains.

In EU, edible insects are considered as Novel Food because they were not consumed to a significant degree by Europeans before May 15, 1997. Therefore, the European Novel Food Regulation (EC n° 258/97) applies, restricting their trade as long as their safety has not been investigated.

However, European countries such as Belgium overcame this regulation, authorizing 10 species to be commercialized.

######Standardization and Industrialization of insect products (1 page)

####Mealworm flour as a solution (2 pages)
The reason why we choose to focus on one type of insect flour is that it adresses some of the key drivers : Acceptance in the West by disguising the original shape of an insect, standarization in order to make it possible to use it in lots of products and industrialization to lower the cost of insect food.

####Market
#####Impact assessment of mealworm flour (X pages)
Insects for food is a nascent industry. As we want to advance the knowledge about it and provide a better understanding of the future possibilities it can achieve, we want to do an impact assessment. More specific, we want to quantify the impact insects for food can have on other related food products in terms of **economic, ecologic and health gain**.

The industries we will compare it to are :

for humans :

Meat substitutes

Fitness proteins

Burgers

Sausages

Snacks

Meat in general

for animals :

Chicken feed

Fish feed

Pet food
#####A competitive analysis of mealworm flour (5 pages)
Based on Porter's 5 forces :

######Threat of new entrants

######Threat of substitute products or services

######Bargaining power of customers (buyers)

######Bargaining power of suppliers

######Intensity of competitive rivalry

####Norms
#####acceptance of mealworm flour
#####health issues in mealworm flour

####Law
#####Current legislation in the main markets for mealworm flour
#####prospects on legislation for mealworm flour
an idea is that we can investigate how modern data collecting technology can possitively influence policy makers?

####Technology

#####Potential technologies for insect industry (2 pages)
This section examines technology and processes used in other industries that can possibly be used in the insect industry.
#####Our own production improvement solution (X pages)
An explanation of the working principles of a production process we will invent/improve to help towards the industrialization of insects for food. A strategy is to draw inspiration from other industries. A test set up will be done on campus.
