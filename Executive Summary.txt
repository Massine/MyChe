This fast evoluation is due to several factors like the transportation cost, the social awareness, the governments supports for these activities and other aspects related to the people's way of life.
All these aspects are studied in this following report and supported by statistics and data from different sources. Firstly the carpooling and ridesharing market and its evolution is presented. Then a developpment of each aspect that make people to carpool helps to understant the reasons of the evolution and also the possible obstacles to carpooling.Thus after constating that a flexible mobility is an important criteri for people, ther technology part explains how the new hardware technologies based on connected devices and the new software developments, like de distributed and decentrilized systems, could help the market by reducting the obstacle to carpool.
But this situation generated a new legal "desert". Indeed, the developpment of carpooliing was faster that the modification of the law. Thus, this industry is eigher suffering from an eccess of restriction or beneficing from the total abscence of law which is responsible, most of the time, of conflicts with classic transportation industries.

Conclusion:

Currently the largest companies in the carpooling industry are Uber, Lyft, Blablacar, Kuaidi.  Many other new companies also start their businesses and can be successful due to access to open-source hardware and software and also with the use of new technologies like blockchain. 
Every month thousands of people add to this share networks, with the purpose of share expenses, earn money, enjoy a more personalized transport service, have real interaction with people and others.  The competition between companies is ferocious. Most of them have been in the last 3 years collecting huge amount of funds from venture companies, with the purpose to implement their marketing strategies and spread the network of users locally and globally in some cases.
