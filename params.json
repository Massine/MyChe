{"name":"Myche","tagline":"Project folder","body":"This page will present our project in Global Manufacturing Strategy class. Our group of 3 people worked to write an Industry Analysis Report related to the Carpooling industry. \r\n\r\n### Project presentation\r\nCarpooling is an option whether or not own or drive a car. If someone knows that he travels using the same route as a neighbor or co-worker, they can consider arranging to carpool or ride-share. Carpooling is seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods.\r\nCarpool practicing is highly dependent on the several factors which make people more or less attracted by this activity. This market is influenced by the price of energy, the law in the different countries and the culture of people, but not only. The development of new technologies is one of the most booster for the market. In this IAR we are going to analyze the impact of all these factors. \r\n\r\n### Logic Model\r\nDuring this project we are going to follow a Logic Model. This model presents the major elements and steps of our project.\r\n![](http://uprapide.com/image/973976-logicmodel)\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
