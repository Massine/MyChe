{"name":"Myche","tagline":"Project folder","body":"This page will present our project in Global Manufacturing Strategy class. Our group of 3 people worked to write an Industry Analysis Report related to the Carpooling industry. \r\n\r\n### Project presentation\r\nCarpooling is an option whether or not own or drive a car. If someone knows that he travels using the same route as a neighbor or co-worker, they can consider arranging to carpool or ride-share. Carpooling is seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods.\r\nCarpool practicing is highly dependent on the several factors which make people more or less attracted by this activity. This market is influenced by the price of energy, the law in the different countries and the culture of people, but not only. The development of new technologies is one of the most booster for the market. In this IAR we are going to analyze the impact of all these factors. \r\n\r\n### Logic Model\r\nDuring this project we are going to follow a Logic Model. This model presents the major elements and steps of our project.\r\n\r\n![](http://uprapide.com/image/973976-logicmodel)\r\n\r\n### Market Analysis\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Environment impact\r\nEven if this is not the first motivation of carpoolers, reducing the number cars on the road will reduce the pollution. By taking the decision to use carpooling, the users can contribute to the protection of the planet. This awareness regarding the environment is also a motivation for the companies to propose carpooling services for its employees and encourage them to reduce the CO2 emissions at their scale.\r\n\r\n### Technologies analysis\r\nDynamic carpooling consists on managing a continuous access to the carpooling available offers. A real time access is provided through a continuous updating of the offers and the demands. the popularization of smartphones, tablets, connected devices, free access to the Wifi, GPS, 3G, 4G… the ‘in real time” became totally possible and accessible for all people. Then the implementation of decentralized systems like Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) or Blockchain will help the market to grow. The objective of these Agents is to successfully associate the different users through an optimization process subjected to several, complex and variable constraints.\r\n\r\n### Public policy and Social aspects\r\nThe market is highly dependent on the public policy and the social awareness. If these two aspects could be an opportunity, some public politics are obstacles for the development of this kind of markets. Due to the high competition in the transportation industry, some countries prefer to protect the classic market from this kind of activities. This IAR will study the differences of Law and Culture in different countries to try to highlight the points that are going to help this market. \r\n\r\n### References\r\nYou can find all our references in this [git folder](https://github.com/Massine/MyChe/tree/master/Refrences).  \r\nADEME. «ALLÉGER L’EMPREINTE ALLÉGER L’EMPREINTE DE LA CONSOMMATION DES FRANÇAIS EN 2030.» 2014.\r\n\r\nLeviers d’actions pour favoriser le covoiturage de courte distance, évaluation de l’impact sur les polluants atmosphériques et le co2.
