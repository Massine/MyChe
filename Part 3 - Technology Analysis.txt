Part 3: Technology Analysis

	Used Technologies and some limits

Most of carpooling systems could be described as static carpooling systems. The implementation of the concept is usually made through a simple website which can only save and display the available offers. The only advantage of this solution is the simplicity of implementation. A registration is required from potential users to have access to the full functionalities of the website. But unfortunately, the provided functionalities consists only in adding or consulting the offers with different options like the type of the car that don’t change anything to the transportation problematics. For those websites, a data base is necessary to save the uploaded offers and answer the consultation requests. The only technological aspect that is important to deal with is the storage capacity which is absolutely not a problem nowadays. Indeed the management of those databases is very simple.
