### Massine ###
After a preparatory class in France, I entered an engineering school specialized in Mechanics and Energy. After two years in this school and an Internship in automotive industry, I decided to take a double degree program in Tsinghua University.
For me it was an opportunity to study abroad first and then to study Industrial Engineering completing my initial background in mechanics.
